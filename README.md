## 🚀 About The Project

Calculating grades and planning finances shouldn't be a headache. This project is an **all-in-one academic toolkit** designed specifically for **United International University (UIU)** students.

It replaces manual calculation errors with a fast, responsive, and mobile-friendly interface.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🎓 CGPA Calculator:** Instantly calculates your GPA and CGPA based on the official UIU grading policy.
*   **🎯 Target CGPA Planner:** The "Magic" tool. Tell it your current CGPA and your goal (e.g., "I want a 3.5"), and it tells you exactly what GPA you need in the next trimester.
*   **💰 Tuition Fee Calculator:** Enter redits and waiver/scholarship percentage to get an accurate breakdown of your installment fees.
